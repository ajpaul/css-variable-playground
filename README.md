# CSS Variable playground

I just found out about CSS variables. This is a small test app to manipulate some CSS variables using vanilla JS. The variables control flex justify-content properties, box-shadow, margins, and color. It seems like it could be handy, but since I am usually using Less, I don't know if I'll ever really utilize this.
